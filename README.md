## Training the LP detector

To train the LP detector network from scratch, or fine-tuning it for new samples, you can use the train-detector.py script. In folder samples/train-detector there are 3 annotated samples which are used just for demonstration purposes. To correctly reproduce our experiments, this folder must be filled with all the annotations provided in the training set, and their respective images transferred from the original datasets.

The following command can be used to train the network from scratch considering the data inside the train-detector folder:

```shellscript
$ mkdir models
$ python create-model.py eccv models/eccv-model-scracth
$ python train-detector.py --model models/eccv-model-scracth --name my-trained-model --train-dir samples/train-detector --output-dir models/my-trained-model/ -op Adam -lr .001 -its 300000 -bs 64
```

For fine-tunning, use your model with --model option.
